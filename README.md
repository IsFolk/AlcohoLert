**(This project was finished on 2022 Aug, the repo showing now is the public version of it (for some credential reasons I cannot make the origin Github repo public))**

## Description
An IoT vehicle tracking face recognition device using Raspberry Pi 4 with sensors and an Intel Neural Compute Stick in Python, along with a Kotlin mobile application to track the vehicle.

This is a graduation group project from the National Central Univeristy, MIS major.

This repo is the code of Raspberry Pi 4 part.

Here is the device structure:
